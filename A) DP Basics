How to identify Recursion:
1) The question says to count total number of possible ways [in such ques we return 1 from the base case in the recursive code]
2) There are multiple ways to do a task but we need to find the max/min output.


Recursion-> DP :
* DP is applied when we can find the optimal solution of a bigger problem using smaller subproblems
* There should be overlapping subproblems(same subproblems appearing again and again) eg..while 
  calculating the nth fibonacci number we count the fibonacci of a particular number multiple number of times.
  So, we can store the pre-calculated results in an array and return it whenever required.


How to find the correct Recurrence Relation :
1) Try and represent the problem in terms of index.
2) Do all possible stuffs on that according to the problem statement.
3) If asked to count all ways-> Sum of those stuffs and return it (also return 1 from base case)
   If asked to find the max or min then find max/min in each recursion step.


Memoization --> Tabulation
1) Declare base case
2) Express all the states in for loop ( all the possible places/states possible).
3) Copy the recurrence as written in the memoization code and write it.
